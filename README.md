# top-rock-paper-scissors.
First Java Script project for TOP.

Update after I've finished the project.

It's been kind of tough. Especially the part where they wanted me to use parameters in playRound. I will have to
further research and understand that. 

These are the steps through the project:

- Random number generating function.
- Getting computer's choice based on the number chosen and assigning it a string based on the number.
- Taking in player's input through a prompt and converting it to lowerCase. In case the input is something unexpected
  give the player an alert of what the input was and restart the function.
- Make a function to play the round that calls 2 previous functions in order to get the inputs and then compares them
  in order to see who won, then adjust the score(s).
- Create a function that will replay the round function x amount of times and once the "for" loop is over it displays
  the final scores and proclaims the winner.

In the next project I will try to write rock paper scissors without any sort of assistance. Also, I will add HTML and CSS to it
and make it interactive and hopefuly somewhat visually appealing.
